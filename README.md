 Different users will see unique, bizarre name suggestions tailored to their chosen pet type.

Key Features:

User authentication to save and retrieve personalized weird pet names Randomized name generation based on pet type (dog, cat, etc.).

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js,Tailwind.
CSS Backend: Node.js,Express.js, MongoDB

Why This Project:

 I chose this project because pet names are often either too basic or too seriousâ€”this aims to change that with maximum absurdity.
Its a fun way to explore authentication, database interactions, and user-generated content while ensuring every pet has a truly unique (and ridiculous) identity.

  ### *Creating the Server & Pushing into Bruno*  

This guide covers setting up a simple server and testing API requests using *Bruno*.  

#### *â¿¡ Setting Up the Server*  
Begin by creating a new project and installing the necessary dependencies. Configure the server to handle API requests and responses. Ensure the server is set up to run on a specified port.  

#### *â¿¢ Running the Server*  
Start the server and verify that it is running correctly. Check for any errors and ensure that the server is listening for incoming requests.  

#### *â¿£ Testing with Bruno*  
Open *Bruno* and create a new collection for your API. Add a request with the appropriate method and endpoint. Send the request and verify the response.  

#### *â¿¤ Pushing to Bruno Hub (Optional)*  
If needed, sync your collection with *Bruno Hub* for easy sharing and collaboration. This allows for better organization and accessibility of API requests.  

With these steps, you have successfully set up a server and tested itÂ usingÂ Bruno!Â ðŸš€
